To build the software through Android Studio - choose an Android OS device and press the play button. This is open an emulator with the application running.

The software is self explanatory. When opening the app you will be able to input your first and last name. Currently setting the alarm does not work fully. The calendar page lets you pick a day and a popup form will appear giving you the option to pick what your mood was for the day. The settings page light/night mode sort of works. You can go from light to night mode in one toggle however to go back to light mode it requires you to hit the toggle twice. Will try to fix that soon.

The most updated apk is in this same directory.
